# Archestra #3854 audit log bounty artifact

## Bounty reference

Target: https://github.com/archestra-ai/archestra/issues/3854

Verified via GitHub connector on 2026-05-12: issue is open, labeled `💎 Bounty` and `$250`, and assigned to `abhinav-m22`.

I cannot open a direct upstream PR from this environment because GitHub CLI/user authentication is unavailable, no SSH fork exists for the target repository, and connector writes are limited to the evidence repository.

This artifact is therefore a public report and prepared-patch record, not an upstream PR.

## Summary

Prepared branch: `bounty-3854-audit-logs`

The implementation adds an admin-only audit log surface for organization activity:

- records authenticated mutating API requests in a new `audit_logs` table
- exposes `GET /api/audit-logs` with pagination, sorting, filters, and RBAC
- adds Settings > Audit Logs with search, user/method/status/date filters, sorting, and pagination
- updates generated OpenAPI and shared API client types

The audit hook records user, organization, action/route, method, path, response status, IP address, user agent, request ID, and route params. It intentionally does not store request bodies because API payloads can contain secrets.

## Scope and safety

# Archestra #3854 Bounty: Admin Audit Log Implementation

## Overview

This implementation adds an admin-only audit log system for organization activity monitoring.

## Implementation Summary

### Database Schema Changes

Added new `audit_logs` table:

- Records all authenticated mutating API requests
- Stores: user, organization, action/route, method, path, response status, IP address, user agent, request ID, and route params
- Does not store request bodies (for security/privacy reasons)

### API Endpoints

Added new endpoint:
- `GET /api/audit-logs` with pagination, sorting, and filters
- Protected by RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) for admin access only

### Frontend Changes

Added Settings > Audit Logs page with:
- Search functionality
- User filter capabilities
- Method filter capabilities
- Status filter capabilities
- Date range filtering
- Column sorting
- Pagination support

### Technical Implementation

The audit system hooks into authenticated mutating API requests and records:

- User information (ID, organization)
- Request details (method, path, action/route)
- Response metadata (status code)
- Client information (IP address, user agent)
- Request correlation (request ID)
- Request parameters


### Security Features

- Admin-only access control to prevent unauthorized viewing
- No storage of request bodies to protect sensitive data
- Full RBAC integration for access control

## File Changes Structure


No production probing was performed. This is a prepared implementation artifact for a public feature/security-accountability bounty while direct upstream PR creation is blocked.
